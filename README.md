-   I learned about useState, creating a component and messing around with conditionals in elements.

_Examples:_

```
let items = ['a', 'b', 'c]
{if items.length == 0 ? <p>No Item Found!<p/> : null}

OR

{if items.length == 0 && <p>No Item Found!<p/>}
```

-   I learned about using props, adding datatype, passing props to the component.
-   props are immutable while state is mutable and manage the data .
